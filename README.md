# Framer Motion Cheatsheet

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project that demonstrates using [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) to create animations in React. 

Framer Motion is a production-ready motion library that helps developers craft immersive user experiences by adding gestures, transitions, and animations to their web apps.

This project contains examples of Framer Motion animations like page transitions, drag gestures, scroll-based animations, animated SVG morphing, and more.  It aims to showcase the capabilities of Framer Motion in a Next.js codebase and serve as a cheatsheet for Framer Motion usage.

The project uses:

- React for building UI components
- Next.js as the React framework
- Framer Motion for animations
- Tailwind CSS for styling

To learn more about the implementations, view the source code in the `pages/` and `components/` directories which contain examples of:

- `motion` components for animating divs 
- Layout animations
- Drag gestures with `drag` prop
- Keyframe-based animations
- SVG Path animations

You can also consult the official Framer Motion and Next.js documentation for more insights.

This demo app is a great starting point for adding motion to your Next.js projects and experimenting with the animation capabilities of Framer Motion.
